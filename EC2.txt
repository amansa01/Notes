Upgrading EBS Volume
Exam ques: can ec2 instance in one avability zone and ebs volume in another avability zone. can ec2 instance mount that ? Ans is no they have to be in same region.

To modify ebs volumes.
Go to volumess.
select a volume and go to actions and modify volume.(instance stopping not required now.)

to move the ebs volume/ ec2 instance from one to another create a snapshot of existing volume and then create a new volume/ec2 instance from the snapshot in another region.
You can share snapshots but only if they are unencrypted
