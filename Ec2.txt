EC2-elastic compute cloud
provides resizable compute capacity.virtual machine in clouds.

Ec2 options
on Demand : fixed rate by hour/second with no commitment
Reserved : 1-3 years of contract.
spot : bid your price for instance
Dedicated hosts : physical Ec2 server dedicated for your use.

Instance Type : 
not required to remember for associate exams
F-FGPA
I-IOPS
G-Graphics
H-High Dish Throughput
T-General Purpose
D-Density
R-Ram
M-Main choice for general purpose apps
C-compute
P-graphics(pics)
X-Exxtreme memory

EBS (elastic block storage)
create storage volumes and attach them to Ec2 instances.

Volume types :
SSD
General purpose SSD- 3 IOPS/GB upto 10000 IOPS. burst upto 3000 IOPS for etended period of time for volumes at 3334 GB.
Provisioned IOPS SSD :Designed for I/o  intensive app such as large relational or NOSQL Db.can be used if 10000 IOPS is req. can go up to 20,000 IOPS

MAgnetic
Throughput optimized : Big Data,data warehouing ,cannot be a boot volume.
Cold HDD : Lowest cost Storage for infrequently accessed workloads.cannot be a boot volume

Magnetic (standard) : data is accessed infrequently. can be bootable.


1subnet will be avilable in only 1 avilability zone
Security Groups are stateful
security group is kind of a (virtual firewall).
Any rule change you apply to security group is applied immediately.
Outbound rules are added automatically when an Inbound rule is added.
while editing Inbound rules it cant Deny traffic.By default everything is blocked you can just allow traffic.

Dfault Inbound traffic is blocked by default.
Dfault Outbound traffic is Allowed by default.

You can add more than one security group by going in Actions and updating security groups. 

EBS Volume : Ec2 instance and EBS volume should be in same avaibility zone.
You can change EBS volume size on the fly.

EBS root volume of default AMI cannot be encrypted.It can be encrypted using 3rd party tool or while taking snapshot.

Termination protection is off by default while booting an ec2 instance
2 different type status check

If we terminate a Ec2 instance by default only root volume is terminated not the other volumes.

Snapshot exist on s3.Snapshot are point in copies of volumes.
Snapshots are incremental.

To move an Ec2 volume from Az/region to another, take a snap or an image of it, then copy it to new AZ/Region.

You can share snapshot,but only if they are unencrypted.
