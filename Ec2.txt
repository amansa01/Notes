EC2-elastic compute cloud
provides resizable compute capacity.virtual machine in clouds.

Ec2 options
on Demand : fixed rate by hour/second with no commitment
Reserved : 1-3 years of contract.
spot : bid your price for instance
Dedicated hosts : physical Ec2 server dedicated for your use.

Instance Type : 
not required to remember for associate exams
F-FGPA
I-IOPS
G-Graphics
H-High Dish Throughput
T-General Purpose
D-Density
R-Ram
M-Main choice for general purpose apps
C-compute
P-graphics(pics)
X-Exxtreme memory

EBS (elastic block storage)
create storage volumes and attach them to Ec2 instances.

Volume types :
SSD
General purpose SSD- 3 IOPS/GB upto 10000 IOPS. burst upto 3000 IOPS for etended period of time for volumes at 3334 GB.
Provisioned IOPS SSD :Designed for I/o  intensive app such as large relational or NOSQL Db.can be used if 10000 IOPS is req. can go up to 20,000 IOPS

MAgnetic
Throughput optimized : Big Data,data warehouing ,cannot be a boot volume.
Cold HDD : Lowest cost Storage for infrequently accessed workloads.cannot be a boot volume

Magnetic (standard) : data is accessed infrequently. can be bootable.


1subnet will be avilable in only 1 avilability zone
security group is kind of a (virtual firewall)
EBS root volume of default AMI cannot be encrypted.It can be encrypted using 3rd party tool or while taking snapshot.
Termination protection is off by default while booting an ec2 instance
2 different type status check
