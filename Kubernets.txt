Building block of Kubernets: 
Minions (Nodes) : can think of it as CONTAINER CLIENTS.These are individual hosts that docker is installed on and hosts the various conatiners within your managed clusters.

Each Minion will run ETCD (key managment and communication service used by kubernets for exchanging msgs and reporting on cluster status) 

Pods :  pod consists of one or more container.these pods are guranteed to be located on same host machine in order to share resources.

pods are assingned unique ips within each cluster.
pod managment is done through API or delegated to a controller

Labels : key-value pairs used to identify pods or minions for configuration and managment.

Selectors : Label selectors represent queries that are made against those labels.They resolve to the corresponding matching objects.


Controllers : 
these are the mechanism by which your desired configuration state is enforced.

Services  : 
be default service is only exposed inside a cluster , it can also be eposed outside a cluster as needed.
